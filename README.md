This is a C# library for implementing the Experience API (xAPI) in .Net applications.  It relies on the excellent work of Rustici Software with their TinCan.Net project.  
 
The reason for this extension of that project is that I needed to utilize some elements of xAPI that were not part of TinCan.Net.

1) Added ability to write cmi.interaction xAPI statements. 
2) Added handling of Attachments in xAPI statements.


The library targets .Net 4.8 runtime.
